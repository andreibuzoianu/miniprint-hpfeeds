A medium interaction printer honeypot

This is a modified version of miniprint to work with hpfeeds and mhn.

## About 

miniprint acts like a standard networked printer that has been accidentally exposed to the public internet. 

It speaks the Printer Job Language (PJL) over the raw network "protocol"

## Features
* A fully-featured virtual filesystem in which attackers can read and write files and directories - nothing gets written to the host
* Any PostScript or plaintext print jobs sent to the printer will be saved to the `uploads/` directory
* Extensive (probably too much) logging
* Shodan Honeycore: 0

## Installation
1. `virtualenv venv && source ./venv/bin/activate` (optional)
1. `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
1. `python3 ./server.py`

## Usage
```
usage: miniprint [-b,--bind HOST] [-l,--log-file FILE] [-t,--time-out TIME] [-h]

       by Dan Salmon: @BLTjetpack, github.com/sa7mon 

optional arguments:
  -b, --bind <host>       Bind the server to <host> (default: localhost)
  -l, --log-file <file>   Save all logs to <file> (default: ./miniprint.log)
  -t, --timeout <time>    Wait up to <time> seconds for commands before disconnecting client (default: 120)

  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
```
To interactively attack `miniprint` on localhost, you can use [PRET](https://github.com/RUB-NDS/PRET) with the following command: `python ./pret.py localhost pjl`

Logs are generated in format: `time - loglevel - method - operation - message` and are saved to `miniprint.log` by default.

## Requirements
  * Python >= 3.5
